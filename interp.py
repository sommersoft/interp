Interpolation functions derived from Numpy


* Author(s): Fox95

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

.. todo:: Add links to any specific hardware product page(s), or category page(s). Use unordered list & hyperlink rST
   inline format: "* `Link Text <url>`_"

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases

.. todo:: Uncomment or remove the Bus Device and/or the Register library dependencies based on the library's use of either.

# * Adafruit's Bus Device library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice
# * Adafruit's Register library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register
